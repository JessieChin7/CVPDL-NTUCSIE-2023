## Model - DINO
![method](figs/framework.png "model arch")
This is the official implementation of the paper "[DINO: DETR with Improved DeNoising Anchor Boxes for End-to-End Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03605)". 
(DINO pronounced `daɪnoʊ' as in dinosaur)

## Installation and Data setting

<details>
  <summary>Installation</summary>
  
  We use the environment same to DAB-DETR and DN-DETR to run DINO. If you have run DN-DETR or DAB-DETR, you can skip this step. 
  We test our models under ```python=3.7.3,pytorch=1.9.0,cuda=11.1```. Other versions might be available as well. Click the `Details` below for more details.

   1. Clone this repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DINO.git
   cd DINO
   ```

   2. Install Pytorch and torchvision

   Follow the instruction on https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.
   ```sh
   # an example:
   conda install -c pytorch pytorch torchvision
   ```

   3. Install other needed packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   4. Compiling CUDA operators
   ```sh
   cd models/dino/ops
   python setup.py build install
   # unit test (should see all checking is True)
   python test.py
   cd ../../..
   ```
